# Brain Tumor detection

## Introduction
Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging with profound implications for patient diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods of tumor detection rely heavily on manual inspection by radiologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. With the advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of large medical imaging datasets, there has been a surge in the development of automated brain tumor detection systems.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting brain tumors from medical imaging data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. By leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms, we aim to create a system that can assist healthcare professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, leading to better patient outcomes.
